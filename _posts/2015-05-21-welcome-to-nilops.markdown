I'm wiring up nilops.com to Jekyll and Typescript.  Heaven save me.  We'll deploy a demo site in golang via Elastic Beanstalk (or ECS, if beanstalk is too much a PITA) and move on from there.

The main focus is a light set of Typescript wiring up website interaction tracking to a backend recording the clickstream events.  Probably just click events initially but movement vectors would be nice / v2.
